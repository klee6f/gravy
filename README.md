Synopsis
For this challenge you will implement the Giant Bomb API to create an application that will allow a user to search games and "rent" them. The application should consist of at least two unique pages (search and checkout). Your view should display the game thumbnail and title, and the rest is up to you. You can use any language and or framework you'd like.
